Panel Sessions are discussions amongst selected speakers and OSR attendees about various relevant topics, spaning across all aspects of open science practices.
In the 2022 OSR, we aim to address new and emerging topics in the discipline, along with big picture issues in open science. The OSR Pannel Sessions are also a space to meet 
and interact with invited pannelists about a multitude of topics. Since this year's OSR is hybrid, we aim to create in-person and virtual sessions, which will be 'live' and re-broadcasted
to support everyone in making real connections with other attendees and panelists.
