What are panel sessions?
Panel Sessions are discussions amongst selected speakers and OSR attendees about various relevant topics, spaning across all aspects of open science practices.
In the 2022 OSR, we aim to address new and emerging topics in the discipline, along with big picture issues in open science. The OSR Pannel Sessions are also a space to meet 
and interact with invited pannelists about a multitude of topics. Since this year's OSR is hybrid, we aim to create in-person and virtual sessions, which will be 'live' and re-broadcasted
to support everyone in making real connections with other attendees and panelists.

What is the format of panel sessions?
Panel discussions will feature a host that will moderate a predetermined topic of discussion among a panel of speakers.
Speakers will be selected based on relevancy to the chosen panel topic. Panels typically involve 5 speakers per panel.
Questions from the audience are encouraged (via chat feature if virtual) and will be transmitted to the panel by the host throughout the session.
