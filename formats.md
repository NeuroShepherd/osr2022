<p **What are panel sessions?**
Panel Sessions are discussions amongst selected speakers and OSR attendees about various relevant topics, spaning across all aspects of open science practices.
In the 2022 OSR, we aim to address new and emerging topics in the discipline, along with big picture issues in open science. The OSR Pannel Sessions are also a space to meet 
and interact with invited pannelists about a multitude of topics. Since this year's OSR is hybrid, we aim to create in-person and virtual sessions, which will be 'live' and re-broadcasted
to support everyone in making real connections with other attendees and panelists.
</p>

<p **What is the format of panel sessions?**
Panel discussions will feature a host that will moderate a predetermined topic of discussion among a panel of speakers.
Speakers will be selected based on relevancy to the chosen panel topic. Panels typically involve 5 speakers per panel.
Questions from the audience are encouraged (via chat feature if virtual) and will be transmitted to the panel by the host throughout the session.

<p align="justify">**Emergent sessions** are [bookable](/submit.md){:target="_blank"} during the meeting for times allocated for emergent sessions. Emergent sessions can be booked by any OHBM or OSR registered participant at any point in the meeting, while there is space in the schedule. Submitted emergent requests will be briefly reviewed by the OSR team for appropriate content, and details communicated regarding how to book a slot in our schedule. We will be on hand to manage the hosting and broadcast of your session on your behalf, and help your participants join the conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">Emergent sessions may last from 15 minutes to one hour. The duration will be set by the participant organiser, or it will run for as long as the conversation is flowing.</p>
<p align="justify">Emergent sessions can be framed as conversations held in an open format among peers. These sessions may be used to invite contributions to collaborative projects, hold an open forum to discuss a development in existing projects, hold a panel discussion, or basically anything you would like!</p>
<p align="justify">All emergent sessions will be recorded (unless we have specific reason to think this would inhibit discussion) and made available for viewing on Crowdcast straight after the event. Links to this “spontaneously” recorded material will be shared with registered participants.
