<p align="justify"><strong>What are Panel Sessions?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> Panel Sessions are discussions amongst selected speakers and OSR attendees about various relevant topics, spanning across all aspects of open science practices.
In the 2022 OSR, we aim to address new and emerging topics in the discipline, along with big picture issues in open science. The OSR Panel Sessions are also a space to meet 
and interact with invited panelists about a multitude of topics. Since this year‚Äôs OSR is hybrid, we aim to create in-person and virtual sessions, which will be ‚Äòlive‚Äô and re-broadcasted
to support everyone in making real connections with other attendees and panelists.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>What is the format of Panel Sessions?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Panel Sessions will feature a host that will moderate a predetermined topic of discussion among a panel of speakers.
Speakers will be selected based on relevancy to the chosen panel topic. Panels typically involve 5 speakers per panel.
Questions from the audience are encouraged (via chat feature if virtual) and will be transmitted to the panel by the host throughout the session.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>What are Emergent Sessions?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> Emergent Sessions are spontaneous and interactive hot topic talks hosted by OSR attendees. Emergent sessions may last from 15 minutes to one hour. The duration will be set by the participant organizer, or it will run for as long as the conversation is flowing. Emergent Sessions can be framed as conversations held in an open format among peers. These sessions may be used to invite contributions to collaborative projects,hold an open forum to discuss a development in existing projects, hold a panel discussion, or basically anything you would like!</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Emergent Sessions</strong> are <a href="/submit.md" target="_blank">bookable</a>.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>How do I host an Emergent Session?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> Emergent Sessions are bookable during the meeting for times allocated for Emergent Sessions. 
Emergent Sessions can be booked by any OHBM or OSR registered participant at any point in the meeting, while there is space in the schedule. 
Submitted Emergent requests will be briefly reviewed by the OSR team for appropriate content, and details communicated regarding how to book a slot in our schedule. We will be on hand to manage the hosting and broadcast of your session on your behalf, and help your participants join the conversation.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>How can I attend Emergent Sessions if I am a virtual attendee?</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> All Emergent Sessions will be live streamed and recorded (unless we have specific reason to think this would inhibit discussion). The recorded sessions will be made available for viewing on Crowdcast straight after the event. Links to this ‚Äúspontaneously‚Äù recorded material will be shared with registered participants.</p>
